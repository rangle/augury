Despite aiding the Legion against Daxamite terrorists, Garth was still not allowed to rejoin, so he went off again to find his brother. When he found Mekt, his mind had snapped, and he was a deadly criminal. Mekt abducted Garth and shot his right arm off.

When Cosmic Boy disappeared after the Dominators attempted to take over Earth, a public election was held for Legion leadership. <a href=\"\/supergirl\/4005-2351\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl<\/a> was elected with Lightning Lad her deputy.

This same event also left Garth with a lightning bolt scar over one eye, which lit up when he used his powers. During the two seasons of the show, Garth had a flirtation with Saturn Girl but never properly developed a romance. He often butted heads with fellow co-founder Cosmic Boy on issues and Saturn Girl specifically. He appeared in every episode of season one and all but \"Cry Wolf\", \"Unnatural Alliances\", and \"Trials\" in season two.<\/p><p>In season one, Garth joined the Legion of Super-Villains to be with his brother Mekt and leave behind his immature Legion teammates but quickly learned the team wasn't for him.

Naltor's native denizens are genetically inclined to be precognitives, with the ability to see into the future. At a young age, Nura became recognized as the most powerful precog among her people, more able to dream with peculiar accuracy, or see a few moments into the future while awake, than any other. Nura's exceptional beauty often hid the fact that she was also exceptionally bright, and once she reached adulthood, she had already mastered advanced Naltorian science, putting her among the galaxy's intellectual elite. Nura eventually left Naltor to act on one her visions in which she foresaw the death of several members of the <a href=\"\/legion-of-super-heroes\/4060-19241\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-Heroes<\/a> on a mission in space.

She became the sixth female member of the Legion of Super-Heroes and their 20th member overall. As her code name would suggest, Dream Girl was portrayed as the most glamorous member of the Legion, and she was envisioned as a <a href=\"..\/..\/marilyn-monroe\/29-16582\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marilyn Monroe<\/a>-like beauty complete with platinum-blonde hair, revealing silver costumes, high heels, and a star-shaped birthmark on her right cheek.

At one of the Legion's open try-outs, Nura introduced herself as Dream Girl, gaining the attention of the male Legionnaires and the ire of the female Legionnaires. One Legionnaire fell in love with her at first sight, <a href=\"\/starman\/4005-1260\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1260\">Star Boy<\/a>. The male Legionnaires voted her in to the team. Immediately, Dream Girl studied the Legion Constitution, to discover ways to expel the doomed Legionnaires from the team. One by one, she sabotaged them, including <a href=\"\/lightning-lass\/4005-30997\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30997\">Lightning Lass<\/a>, who had her electrical powers seemingly removed by Nura's Naltorian science. The vision Nura had, turned out to be a vision of a test the Legion was doing with crash test dummies that looked like the Legionnaires. Dream Girl also revealed that Lightning Lass' powers had changed from electrical control to the nullification of gravity.<\/p><p>Once the truth of Dream Girl's scheme came out, the Legionnaires invited Dream Girl to stay on the team because she had their best interests in mind. Dream Girl declined the invitation, deciding instead to get more training in her abilities. Dream Girl joined the <a href=\"\/legion-of-substitute-heroes\/4060-47111\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47111\">Legion of Substitute Heroes<\/a> so she would have time to practice and perfect her visions. Later, after Star Boy lost his kryptonian-level powers, and followed her to the Substitute Legion and started their romance. Finally, when it appeared that <a href=\"\/supergirl\/4005-2351\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl<\/a> and <a href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superboy<\/a> were leaving the Legion of Super-Heroes, Star Boy and Dream Girl rejoined the team.<\/p><p>With her stunning pinup-girl looks and figure, a flirty swimsuit-like costume (which she wore even prior to the Legion's sexy-costume era of the 70's), and boldly confident personality, the male Legionnaires completely stopped noticing the other female members on the team, and the female Legionnaires soon grew jealous and resentful. Never one to back down from a challenge, Dream Girl made an effort to reach out to her female teammates, gradually winning them over and befriending them with her natural charm and charisma.<\/p><p> <\/p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1982181\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83063\/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"2.6036585365854\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:260.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83063\/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1982181\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-247)\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83063\/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83063\/1982181-dreamy15.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-247)\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Earth-247)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Nura claimed that her name was Nura Schappin, changing her surname to Nal because, as she put it, \"It just says I'm from Naltor y'know.\" She also claimed to have been the first precognitive to be born on Naltor in seven generations, a claim that was later contradicted by other post-<i>Zero Hour<\/i> Legion stories. For most of this continuity's duration, Nura was not a Legionnaire, although she was still Star Boy's girlfriend. Additionally, she suffered from narcolepsy, falling unconscious whenever she had a vision. She was no longer the sister of <a href=\"\/black-witch\/4005-30998\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30998\">Mysa<\/a>, who was completely unrelated to her in this continuity.

Afterwards, Brainiac 5 announced that Dream Girl's precog power frustrated him to no end because there was no rationality to it and it was not scientific. Dream Girl then interrupted Brainy, talking about a conversation they had not had yet, frustrating him even further. Later, Dream Girl, Karate Kid, <a href=\"..\/..\/shadow-lass\/29-1261\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow Lass<\/a> and Brainiac 5 were all sent to Dream Girl's home planet of Naltor to investigate why no one under the age of 18 was able to sleep.<\/p><p>Brainiac 5 eventually realized that he was in love with her, right before she was killed in the battle that destroyed most of the Legion Headquarters.

At the beginning of the story arc several members of the Legion (including the original Dream Girl in her classic silver costume) mysteriously appeared in the 21st century. Other Legionnaires were scattered and trapped in different places throughout the universe. Dream Girl was captured and imprisoned by the nightmarish villain <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-destiny\/29-10453\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Destiny<\/a> in <a href=\"..\/..\/arkham-asylum\/34-31682\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arkham Asylum<\/a>, where her precognitive powers were manipulated into giving her horrific illusions.

In this revised history the relationship between the two was more tragic, since Starman suffered mental damage after being hurtled back through time unprepared.

After <a href=\"..\/..\/lightning-lad\/29-1253\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lad<\/a>'s term as Legion leader went horribly awry, the team decided it was time to elect a new leader, and Dream Girl announced that she was officially running for the position. The other candidates initially scoffed at the idea of the Legion's glamor girl winning the job, until they realized to their dismay that she would not have announced her candidacy had she not already foreseen herself winning. Sure enough, Dream Girl was elected leader, becoming only the second female Legionnaire ever to do so (after <a href=\"..\/..\/saturn-girl\/29-1273\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl<\/a>).<\/p><p>Shortly after she assumed leadership the Legion was faced with one of the most dire challenges in their history -- the <a href=\"..\/..\/great-darkness-saga\/39-40773\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Darkness Saga<\/a>. The ancient super-villain <a href=\"..\/..\/darkseid\/29-2349\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid<\/a> attempted to conquer the whole of the United Planets. He very nearly succeeded, but the Legion, with Dream Girl's able leadership, finally managed to thwart him after an epic and costly struggle. During this time Nura's sister, Mysa Nal, arrived to aid the team with her mastery of the magical arts. Afterwards Mysa became a Legionnaire, calling herself the <a href=\"..\/..\/white-witch\/29-30998\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Witch<\/a>.<\/p><p>Though Dream Girl again ran for leader the following term, she lost out to Element Lad. Star Boy made no effort to hide his satisfaction about this result. During her stint as leader, their relationship had suffered. After Star Boy left the team to become planetary champion of his home planet, <a href=\"\/xanthu\/4020-56504\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56504\">Xanthu<\/a>.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>The Universo Project<\/h4><p>Dream Girl became one of the first Legion members to demonstrate sufficient willpower to utilize her Legion Flight Ring on an object other than herself, effectively giving her the ability of telekinesis. She later was one of four Legionnaires singled out by <a href=\"\/universo\/4005-22717\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22717\">Universo<\/a> as the most dangerous obstacles in his attempt to take over the Earth (along with Saturn Girl, Brainiac 5, and Chameleon Boy). The four were captured and held prisoner with their memories suppressed. Saturn Girl eventually regained her memory and helped her teammates engineer an escape, after which they turned the tables on Universo. It was assumed that they were isolated as the most dangerous because they were the smartest Legionnaires, but it also could have been that those four had the most resistance to Universo's mind control -- even more than the Legion's (then current) telepath, <a href=\"\/tellus\/4005-30996\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30996\">Tellus<\/a>.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>Mind-controlled by Atmos<\/h4><p>When the ruler of Xanthu (Star Boy's home planet) asked Thom to be their resident hero since their champion <a href=\"\/atmos\/4005-28222\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28222\">Atmos<\/a> had gone missing, Star Boy reluctantly had to take his leave from the Legion and Nura. While Star Boy was away, Atmos turned up during a Legion mission and Nura inexplicably found herself intensely attracted to him. To the surprise of her teammates, she broke up her long-distance relationship with Star Boy and jumped into a romance with Atmos. The truth later became apparent to her that Atmos was somehow using his mental powers to take over her emotions and sap her will. Furious at being so manipulated, she used her own formidable willpower to slowly build up a tolerance to Atmos' mind-sapping powers. She kept this a secret from her erstwhile lover until one night when Atmos had fallen asleep. She regained enough control over herself to activate her Legion flight ring alarm and knocked Atmos out cold with one punch the moment he woke up. Free of Atmos' influence, Nura immediately went back to her true love Thom.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>Five Years Later<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/80419\/1888499-dg30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888499\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 103px\" data-ratio=\"2.3495145631068\" data-width=\"103\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:235.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/80419\/1888499-dg30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888499\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"High Seer (Five Years Later)\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/80419\/1888499-dg30.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/80419\/1888499-dg30.jpg\" alt=\"High Seer (Five Years Later)\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>High Seer (Five Years Later)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After the devastation of the <a href=\"\/the-magic-wars\/4045-56080\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56080\">Magic Wars<\/a>, Legion continuity was re-started after the period known as the Five Year Gap. The galactic economy had collapsed and Earth's government became very hostile towards the Legion. Nura left the team and made her return to Naltor to become its High Seer. She steered Naltor successfully through the troubled times, and under her leadership her world became one of the most stable economies in the United Planets. But Nura felt alone and missed Star Boy terribly, so she went through a series of relationships with several men during this time. In early 2996, after a flash of light that seemed to indicate some sort of time flux, Dream Girl joined her former teammates on Earth, and just before the destruction of the time line, she shared a kiss with her old flame Star Boy before they were wiped out of existence due to the <a href=\"..\/..\/zero-hour\/39-40782\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour<\/a> event.<\/p><p> <\/p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime<\/h3><h4>Guiding the Legion<\/h4><p>On Naltor, the Legionnaires brought a crazed teen before the high council and Dream Girl demanded to know what was being done to fix the problem. She also explained that without dreams, Naltorians could not interpret their visions and would eventually lose their precognitive abilities. The high council of Nltro claimed that the lack of sleep was a disease and not to worry, since it would work itself out. After it was discovered that it was actually the adults committing the crime against the children, Brainiac 5 took off, leaving the other three Legionnaires to fight the Precommandos (Precog Cops). The cops lay a beating on Karate Kid and Shadow Lass, until Dream Girl distracted the police so that they focused their attention solely on her. Taking advantage of the distraction, her teammates took the cops down. Dream Girl knew that more precogs were on the way, but she also knew that there was something the high council did not want the kids to see. She tried to get Karate Kid to knock her out but he refused, so Shadow Lass blindsided her with a mean right hand. Dream Girl then viewed the Destruction of the Universe by an unknown enemy and his army. When she woke up she said one word... 'Brainy'. Dream Girl lead the team to the public service broadcaster where they found Brainy \"attacking the problem\" as he put. It came down to Dream Girl having to choose either to let the youth know what she saw and how little time they had left, or security and comfort. She chose the former.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>Relationship with Brainiac 5<\/h4><p>When the team returned to Legion headquarters, Brainiac 5 explained to Dream Girl how all it would take was one person, one casualty to have the willpower to break destiny; that the universe was more unpredictable than they gave it credit for and her visions did not have to be infallible. Dream Girl told him he would feel differently once they were married.<\/p><p> <\/p><h4>Foreseeing Her Own Death<\/h4><p>After this the Legion's true enemy was revealed: The terrorist group called <a href=\"..\/..\/terra-firma\/65-47457\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Firma<\/a>, lead by the super-powered <a href=\"..\/..\/elysion\/29-1274\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elysion<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/lemnos\/29-1268\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lemnos<\/a>. Terra Firma attacked the planet Helegyn. During this attack Dream girl had a vision but could not see past one hour; after that, all she saw was black. After Elysion was captured, Dream Girl took out her frustrations on him. As she did so, Dream Girl expressed faith, something unheard of for precogs. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl had a romantic moment while he tried to figure out her problem. Then Terra Firma made their move, just as Dream Girl had foreseen. They suicide-bombed Legion Tower and the plaza where teens had gathered to support the Legion. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl headed there. Elysion escaped and, using his earth-controlling powers, brought down Legion Tower on top of everyone around. Amid the chaos, the answer to Dream Girl's problem was answered... she could not see past her own death. Dream Girl was crushed in the rubble of Legion Tower.<\/p><h4>Return to Life<\/h4><p>After she died, Brainiac 5 activated his force field around her dug-out body, which was still in remarkably good condition despite its physical death. Later it was revealed that Brainiac 5 had placed Dream Girl's body in stasis and was using a captured Lemnos try to bring her back to life. At the end of the story arc, he was shown to be successful: Nura's consciousness was transferred into a newly cloned version of her original body with her powers and sight fully restored. In the final issue of this continuity, the happy pair announced to the rest of the team their plans to get married.<\/p><p> <\/p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth<\/h3><h4>The New 52<\/h4><p>The efforts of DC to revitalize its titles led to the New 52 reboot of the universe, in which all DC titles were relaunched simultaneously. The Legion of Super Heroes reverted to a close analogue of their original continuity prior to any of reboots, but it remains to be seen the extent of any changes between the old series and new. Dream Girl and Star Boy are once again an official couple, though she also appears to have a strong relationship with <a href=\"\/brainiac-5\/4005-1255\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5<\/a>.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<\/h2><h3>Precognition<\/h3><p>Dream Girl has the ability to see the future in dreams and visions. This is a power shared by all natives of her home planet Naltor, but Nura's ability to do so is considered to be among the strongest of her race. In addition to the long-range precognition of her dreams, Dream Girl also has the power of short term precognition when in a conscious state, allowing her to see a few seconds into the future at any given moment.<\/p><p><strong>Unarmed Combat<\/strong><\/p><p>Because of her passive power, Dream Girl's early portrayal was a damsel-in-distress who could be easily defeated and captured by enemies, obliging her teammates to rescue her. She resolved to change this and spent long hours with the Legion's ultimate martial arts master, Karate Kid, who gave her extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. She quickly became one of his most gifted students, to the point where she is now the second-most skilled martial artist on the team. Her fighting ability is greatly enhanced by her power to see seconds into the future, which allows her to predict her opponent's moves even before they make them and map out a battle before it actually begins. This makes her a very formidable tactician, and she is able to successfully combat enemies physically far stronger than her, such as the <a href=\"\/\">Persuader<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Intellect<\/h3><p>Nura also possesses a genius-level intellect, and has mastered the highly advanced principles of Naltorian Science. She is one of the few Legionnaires to have received a compliment from Brainiac 5 for intellectual prowess. Because of her great intellect she was chosen for capture by the villain Universo, since he regarded her as one of the Legion's four biggest threats to his domination of Earth (the others being <a href=\"\/saturn-girl\/4005-1273\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1273\">Saturn Girl<\/a>, <a href=\"\/chameleon-boy\/4005-5945\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\">Chameleon Boy<\/a>, and Brainiac 5).<\/p><p> <\/p><h3>Equipment<\/h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Dream Girl possesses a <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-flight-ring\/18-47353\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring<\/a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring. Dream Girl has also employed the ring in various ways unknown to other Legionnaires. Using her great willpower, Nura has used the flight ring to levitate and move other nearby objects as though she has telekinesis.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Other Versions<\/h2><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1982222\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83063\/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.7405303030303\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:174.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83063\/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1982222\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Batch SW6)\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83063\/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/83063\/1982222-dreamy01.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Batch SW6)\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dream Girl (Batch SW6)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The devastation of the <a href=\"\/the-magic-wars\/4045-56080\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56080\">Magic Wars<\/a> caused original Legion continuity to jump ahead five years in what is now known as the Five Year Gap.

She abandoned Querl on his day of birth and he inherited her research. He was speaking by the time he was an infant and functionally working as a scientist by a toddler.

Querl destroyed several of Brande's labs, and when Brande could no longer afford to keep him on staff, Brande sent him to work at the Time Institute on Talus. While there, he met Rond Vidar. Querl received a draft notice from Colu to join the Legion of Super-Heroes. He was so wrapped up in his work, that he ignored it.

Afterward, the current Legion of Super-Heroes has returned to being a close approximation of the original Pre-Crisis team prior to the Five Year Later. Due to the removal of the original Supergirl and the <a href=\"..\/..\/retcon\/12-43566\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">retcon<\/a> addition of the latest Kara Zor-El, Brainiac 5's past was changed. He joined the Legion as before, but without Supergirl accompanying him. Brainiac 5 would later meet the current Kara Zor-El when she was stranded weeks later in the future. He was against the idea of letting her stay. She spent an extended period of time with the team, most notably when Satan Girl attacked Earth. The two teamed up to defeat her, sparking a young romance, before Kara returned home. During this period, Brainiac 5 intentionally rigged the founding Legionnaires' time bubble to visit Superboy rather than Superman.

He sent a team back to the 21st Century with lightning rods to retrieve the essence of <a href=\"\/\">Bart Allen<\/a> after his death as a secret weapon for the future. He also had arranged for <a href=\"\/\">Starman<\/a>, Thom Kallor, to place <a href=\"\/\">Superboy's<\/a> (Kon-El) body in the Kryptonian chrysalis in the 21st Century to be resurrected in the 31st.<\/p><p>Later, <a href=\"\/\">Earth Man<\/a> caused a wave of xenophobia to spread on Earth.

Deported due to his heritage, Brainy took over leadership of Colu to deter the <a href=\"\/\">United Planets<\/a> from going to war with Earth. Superman finally arrived in the 31st Century months later, and helped defeat Earth Man's Justice League. When <a href=\"\/\">Superboy-Prime<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/\">Legion of Super-Villains<\/a> went on a rampage, Brainiac Five was used his previous contingencies of Superboy and Kid Flash to help turn the tide. He also recruited the Legion of Earth-247 and Earth-Prime to help. The Legionnaires eventually defeated the villains, though Earth-Man was forced by the government to join the Legion. Brainy made a special flight ring to keep Earth-Man under control but eventually awarded him a standard one.

The entire Legion assembled and it was Superman who helped free Brainiac 5 from his ancestor's control.

Initially, he only created and patented things like new flavors of ice cream, but soon became more complex with his creations. His greatest invention was a serum that bent light around his body and clothing, rendering him invisible at will. EarthGov became interested in Lyle's discovery and enlisted him to do some investigative work for them. He was joined by the powerless Jacques Foccart, whom Lyle considered a brother, and the young woman who would one day become the villainous <a href=\"\/charma\/4005-52495\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52495\">Charma<\/a>.

As a Legionnaire, Tinya's unique phasing abilities made her a crucial contact between Earth and the Phantom Zone. Tinya and Jo Nah (<a href=\"..\/..\/ultra-boy\/29-1267\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy<\/a>) became one of the earliest Legion couples. Tinya was so taken with Jo that she was willing to aid him even when it was thought he had betrayed the Legion. The two have since formed of the Legion's most enduring couples.

After an incident when Ultra Boy was thought dead, Tinya mourned greatly. She was later ecstatic to discover he was alive but had simply had amnesia. Tinya eventually became the most senior Legionnaire, and has served in the Legion without any absences longer than anyone else in history. As a founder of the Legion Espionage Squad, Tinya displayed remarkable leadership qualities. Despite this, she remained the longest-serving Legionnaire never to be elected as Legion leader (until very recently).<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Phantom Girl's original costume consisted of white tights and a cape, with a stylized black 'P' on her chest.

This \"portholes &amp; bell-bottoms\" costume became her signature look, and is the basis for her current costume.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247<\/h3><figure style=\"width: 233px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-795206\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.1072961373391\" data-width=\"233\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:210.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-795206\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Apparition: Earth-247\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/29837\/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/29837\/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg\" alt=\"Apparition: Earth-247\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Apparition: Earth-247<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the event called <a href=\"..\/..\/zero-hour\/39-40782\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour<\/a>, Legion history was completely rebooted, with this reality later designated as <b>Earth-247<\/b>. Tinya was again one of the earliest Legion recruits, though in this continuity she took the code name <b>Apparition<\/b> rather than Phantom Girl. Bgztl was now an actual planet in the United Planets, rather than a dimensional neighbor, and Tinya's mother, <a href=\"\/winema-wazzo\/4005-12817\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12817\">Winema<\/a>, served as Bgztl's ambassador. Tinya lived with her mother on Earth with no family, having been born to her mother and a drifter. Tinya and Winema were both unaware her father was a Carggite and that Tinya was as well. When she was born and Winema was asleep, he stole two of the three Tinya bodies and sold them off to the Luck Lords. Ignorant of this, Tinya was raised with all the spoils of Winema's career. Apparition joined the Legion after she helped foil an assassination plot at a UP conference, the first recruit alongside Triad. While a Legionnaire, she often argued with her mother. This was especially so when Tinya started to fall in love with the unbecoming Ultra Boy of the <a href=\"\/workforce\/4060-47189\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47189\">Workforce<\/a>. The two dated in secret and professed their love to each other just as a Daxamite terrorist fried them with heat vision, killing Tinya. She was buried on Earth and mourned by the Legion, Ultra Boy, and her mother.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Apparition wore a costume similar to Phantom Girl's original outfit, but with a thick black stripe down the middle rather than a 'P' on her chest.

Tinya Wazzo again went by the Phantom Girl codename and was a member of the Legion. She was a fan of old Earth comic books and had the biggest collection among the heroes. Bgtzl was now a world that was slightly out of phase with Earth and her phasing ability was actually her transporting herself between the planets. She was able to pass back and forth these worlds at will and could often be seen in both, regardless of what she might be doing in one. This led to strange situations and misunderstandings with her teammates. A friend and teammate, <a href=\"\/\">Karate Kid<\/a>, had shown interest in Tinya. But when he finally got the courage to profess his feelings to Phantom Girl, he discovered that she was already in a relationship with a boy from her own dimension who was ironically breaking up with Tinya at the time.

She was once thought to have survived the explosion by being hurled backwards in time (see <b>Alternate Versions<\/b> below), though this turned out to be a duplicate of Tinya rather than Tinya herself.

Only Jo and her mother could initially see her, but soon <a href=\"..\/..\/saturn-girl\/29-1273\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl<\/a> detected her and clued the rest of the Legionnaires in telepathically. While stranded in the 20th century, an encounter with <a href=\"..\/..\/deadman\/29-5690\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deadman<\/a> and a mystic entity made Apparition's spirit visible to all onlookers. Shortly thereafter, Tinya and Jo were secretly married. While in the past, Apparition encountered the heroine Phase. The pair were absorbed into their touchstones when they came near each other and learned Phase was actually one of Tinya's missing bodies, having been lost in time after being sold into slavery. Pulling together to save Ultra Boy, the girls merged for the first time and Apparition was restored to a physical form. Apparition then returned with the Legion to the 30th century and reunited with her mother.<\/p><h4>Pregnancy<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Tinya was on a mission in deep space when the Blight attacked, crippling space travel and forcing Tinya to spend a month in a shuttle just to return to Earth. There, she found Ultra Boy had been blighted and aided the Legion in freeing Earth. Subsequently, Ultra Boy and several other Legionnaires were lost in a spatial rift and presumed dead. The Legion disbanded and Apparition, discovering she was pregnant after Jo had \"died,\" fled to his homeworld of <a href=\"..\/..\/rimbor\/34-57117\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rimbor<\/a> to start a new life. Her Bgztlian pregnancy lasted a year, where she came under the protection of <a href=\"..\/..\/timber-wolf\/29-3619\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Timber Wolf<\/a> and his Wolf Pack gang. She had a healthy phase birth on the day the lost Legionnaires were revealed to be alive. Apparition resolved to rejoin the Legion with her newborn son, Cub, and Timber Wolf accompanied her to protect her. She learned that Ultra Boy had an affair with Saturn Girl during their year of being lost in space, but ultimately forgave him. The pair dealt with their son's rapid aging until Earth-247 was destroyed, leaving Apparition and her Legion the sole survivors as they were lost in the timestream. Tinya was equipped with a utility belt with rations and a transuit that allowed her to breathe in space.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h4>The Missing Body<\/h4><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-846063\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.14\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-846063\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static6.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" alt=\"Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Late in Earth-247 continuity, it was revealed that Tinya's father was actually a Carggite (teammate <a href=\"\/duplicate-girl\/4005-1262\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1262\">Triplicate Girl<\/a>'s race), with the ability to split into three separate bodies, and Tinya had inherited this ability at birth. However, her father was also an chronic gambler who owed a fortune in gambling debts, so when Tinya was just a baby, he made a deal with the mysterious Luck Lords to sell off two of her bodies in order to pay off his debts. Her mother Winema never knew that Tinya's father was a Carggite and never knew about Tinya's other two bodies. One of Tinya's bodies was sold into slavery and her fate remained unknown. The other missing body later turned up in the 20th century in the form of Tinya's \"cousin,\" Enya Wazzo aka <a href=\"\/phase\/4005-12983\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12983\">Phase<\/a> (see Alternate Versions, below).

Tinya helped Projectra cope with the recent death of her parents by reading her ancient comic books from the 20th century, and politely tolerated Projectra's bratty and abusive behavior towards her. Tinya's closeness to Projectra enabled her to learn that Projectra secretly blamed the Legion for her parents' death and the loss of her family fortune. Upon further investigation, Tinya discovered that Projectra was plotting to destroy the Legion in revenge. But before Tinya could alert the Legion, Projectra found her out and savagely attacked her. Tinya initially defended herself by entering her phased state, but Projectra used her powers of illusion to trick Tinya into becoming tangible again and then beat Tinya nearly to death. Her comatose, disfigured body was discovered just in time by <a href=\"\/timber-wolf\/4005-3619\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3619\">Timber Wolf<\/a>, who activated Tinya's alarm beacon. Tinya was brought to the Legion infirmary, where she began to recover, but Projectra then used her powers to alter Tinya's memories before she could tell the Legion what had happened. This plotline was left unresolved when Threeboot continuity was ended by Infinite Crisis.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><h3>Intangibility<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Phantom Girl has the ability to turn intangible by shifting her existence partially or fully into the extra-dimensional space known as the <a href=\"\/phantom-zone\/4020-42370\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\">Phantom Zone<\/a>. When fully phasing out of reality, Tinya is able to enter the Phantom Zone of her own accord. She has also shown the ability to draw people into the Phantom Zone with her. Tinya is the only member of her race known to be able to phase herself completely through the Phantom Zone and onto Earth, which shares extra-dimensional space with her home planet of Bgztl.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While phased, Phantom Girl is immune to physical harm, can maneuver through solid objects, and float weightlessly like a ghost under her own power. Phantom Girl has demonstrated the ability to phase with split-second timing as well as the ability to phase certain parts of her body selectively, feats very few Bgztlians can accomplish. In her \"ghost\" incarnation she has demonstrated the ability to disrupt the workings of electronic devices by moving through them while half-phased.<\/p><h3>Hand-to-Hand Combat<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Phantom Girl has mastered a Bgztlian form of martial arts that takes full advantage of her ability to phase in and out of tangibility during combat. Her skill at striking opponents while solid and becoming intangible when they attack has made her a formidable fighter. By partially materializing a portion of herself (usually her arm\/fist) inside her opponent's body she can also deliver a severe shock to their system, though she rarely resorts to this form of attack.<\/p><h3>Equipment<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As a member of the Legion of Super Heroes, Phantom Girl possesses a <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-flight-ring\/18-47353\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring<\/a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.<\/p><h2>Other Versions<\/h2><h3>20th Century: Phase<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>For further details<\/b>: <a href=\"\/phase\/4005-12983\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12983\">Phase<\/a><\/p><figure style=\"width: 300px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8842\/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-505628\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4333333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8842\/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-505628\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Phase (Enya Wazzo)\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8842\/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8842\/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" alt=\"Phase (Enya Wazzo)\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Phase (Enya Wazzo)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After Tinya Wazzo apparently died when her starship exploded (following the Five Year Gap), she seemingly reappeared in the 20th century, but with no memories of her life in the 30th century.

It was later revealed in Earth-247 continuity that the original Tinya was half-Carggite (Triplicate Girl's race), meaning that she could split into three separate bodies but had lost the ability because one of her bodies was missing in the timestream. Phase, also known as Enya Wazzo and originally believed to be Tinya's time-lost cousin, turned out to be that missing body. Upon learning of this, the 30th-century Tinya traveled back in time to find Enya.

Dr. Zaxton was blamed for the accident and was dismissed. Angered, Dr, Zaxton blamed Dirk for the accident as he was the one who was sent to deliver supplies to him. In a rage, the doctor threw Dirk into an atomic reactor and left him to die. Dirk instead gained special powers due to his unique genetics and used them to help escape. For the adulation, Dirk took on the name Sun Boy and applied for the Legion, but was rejected in favor of <a href=\"\/brainiac-5\/4005-1255\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5<\/a> and <a href=\"\/supergirl\/4005-2351\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl<\/a> for that year's membership slots.

Early on he lost his powers and was sidelined, but they recovered. He became space happy on an extended mission in space where he was leader and locked up his teammates, who eventually saved him. Dirk was hit in the head during a press event and suffered amnesia just as Dr. Regulus returned to seek revenge. Dirk regained his memories in time to defeat his rival, doing so again years later when he returned after Dirk's 11 solar year (17-18 years) birthday party. His powers were instrumental in weakening the Servants of Darkness in the <a href=\"\/great-darkness-saga\/4045-40773\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40773\">Great Darkness Saga<\/a> but <a href=\"\/darkseid\/4005-2349\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid<\/a> continuously knocked him out.

However this Dirk's luminance could not be controlled, which caused him to go under scientific quarantine to protect others. Dirk became frustrated by his months in isolation and escaped to find his father, who had let him be admitted to such a place. During the confrontation with his father, the Legion arrived with a tromium-lined <a href=\"\/legion-transuits\/4055-56566\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56566\">transuit<\/a>.

The battle exposed Dirk to more radiation, which cured him of his powers. Dirk then became the owner of the Magnoball team the Lodestones.

Her ruse failed quickly. While his Kryptonian powers faded and failed him soon after, the Legion elected to keep him after he recovered from his injuries and perfected his mass shifting. Star Boy fell in love with a beautiful new recruit named <a href=\"\/dream-girl\/4005-1254\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1254\">Dream Girl<\/a>. Dreamy joined the Legion under false pretenses and ultimately resigned, but Thom still had feelings for her. Dreamy's biggest fan, Kenz Nuhor, was rejected by her because she reciprocated Star Boy's love and so Kenz set out to kill Star Boy. He lured Thom into a trap and would have killed him had Star Boy not shot and killed Kenz in self defense. Having violated the Legion code against killing, a trial was held and Star Boy was found guilty and expelled from the Legion.<\/p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/26503\/759261-starboy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-759261\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2909482758621\" data-width=\"464\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 464px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/26503\/759261-starboy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-759261\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Star Boy (Earth-247)\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/26503\/759261-starboy.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/26503\/759261-starboy.jpg\" alt=\"Star Boy (Earth-247)\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Star Boy (Earth-247)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>On Earth-247, Thom Kallor was one of the few denizens of Xanthu to be born with a superpower. He was recruited quickly by the government as an adolescent to be a part of the <a href=\"\/uncanny-amazers\/4060-47187\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47187\">Uncanny Amazers<\/a> and was up for the title of Planetary Champion when the Legion of Super-Heroes was founded. Thom was not Xanthu's initial pick as draftee into the Legion, but upon <a href=\"\/james-cullen\/4005-47877\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47877\">Kid Quantum<\/a>'s death they opted for Star Boy to be their new representative. As Thom prepared to set off for Earth, a mourning <a href=\"\/kid-quantum\/4005-1520\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1520\">Kid Quantum II<\/a> rigged Thom's space cruiser so that he couldn't turn its music off. This distraction caused Thom to crash, where he spent several weeks in a body cast recovering. During that time, he was nursed with some exotic whale that sped up his recovery but also granted him Kryptonian-like powers which he discovered upon properly joining the Legion of Super-Heroes.<\/p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/170012-52844-star-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-170012\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.6352941176471\" data-width=\"255\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 255px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:163.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/170012-52844-star-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-170012\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Star Boy (Earth-Prime)\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/77\/170012-52844-star-boy.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/77\/170012-52844-star-boy.jpg\" alt=\"Star Boy (Earth-Prime)\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Star Boy (Earth-Prime)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Star Boy of Earth Prime differed from other realities in that he was of African descent. His origin otherwise was never specified to be any different. He was still from the planet Xanthu. Thom was a member of the Legion again and a big supporter and defendant of initial leader Cosmic Boy. Dream Girl had expressed interest in him before her death, though it was never stated Thom reciprocated. He sided with Cosmic Boy when the Legion stood divided between Cos and Brainiac 5 but pulled together with the rest of his team to defeat Terra Firma. He traveled to <a href=\"\/winath\/4020-56915\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56915\">Winath<\/a> months later to search for the missing Cosmic Boy and instead found <a href=\"\/lightning-lord\/4005-3592\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3592\">Lightning Lord<\/a>, who was charged with the war crimes previously placed on Cos. Wielding the power of gravity like Thom did made him instrumental to several of the Legion's later victories, especially when guided by Brainiac 5's precise calculations.

Following the <a href=\"\/the-magic-wars\/4045-56080\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56080\">Magic Wars<\/a>, Star Boy rejoined the team and was one of several Legionnaires who assisted <a href=\"\/brainiac-5\/4005-1255\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5<\/a> on a covert mission to the 21st century.

He later used his powers on his costume again to travel to New Earth proper. Shortly upon arriving, Thom discovered that the ancient medicine of that era wasn't enough to keep his schizophrenia in check and he had to cope with his mental illness. This made him lucid enough that he forgot his initial mission, instead taking on the name \"Danny Blaine\" from a Xanthu pulp hero and deciding to defend <a href=\"\/opal-city\/4020-47880\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-47880\">Opal City<\/a> like the <a href=\"\/starman\/4050-5259\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5259\">Starmen<\/a> before him. He even took on their codename.<\/p><p>Homeless, he was quickly taken in by Opal's Sunshine Sanitarium to help with his mental confusion. It was there he fell in love with sloppy joes. Shortly thereafter, his heroic efforts in Opal caught the attention of the reformed <a href=\"\/justice-society-of-america\/4060-27589\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\">Justice Society of America<\/a> and Thom was recruited.  He left the JSA after participating in the Lightning Saga crosover then digging up the body of Connor Kent.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Original Continuity: New Earth<\/h3><h4>Star Boy x Dream Girl<\/h4><p>Upon his expulsion, Thom was met by Dream Girl and recruited into the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The pair later left the Subs and donned suits of armor to hide their identities as they joined the Legion as <a href=\"..\/..\/superman\/29-1807\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/supergirl\/29-2351\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl<\/a>'s replacements, per their request. Following Thom's adventure as Sir Prize, the Legion elected to bring Star Boy and Dream Girl back onto the team despite their past actions. Star Boy served on the Legion for many years and continued his relationship with Dream Girl, even during a strained part of their relationship years later when Dream Girl was elected Legion leader. She eventually offered Thom the job of her deputy leader so they could spend more time together, which he only begrudgingly accepted because her term was almost over. On a mission to Xanthu and following a rough patch with Dreamy, Thom was commanded by his people's government to serve as their new planetary champion. Star Boy accepted the position and resigned from the Legion to care for his homeworld. He warded off <a href=\"..\/..\/atmos\/29-28222\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atmos<\/a> in battle several times to keep the title, though he lost Dream Girl to the other hero.<\/p><h4>Five Years Later<\/h4><p>Star Boy rejoined the Legion following the <a href=\"..\/..\/the-magic-wars\/39-56080\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars<\/a> but only served for a short time. With the Legion falling on dark times, Thom returned to Xanthu. He fell in love with and later married Yvyya, the owner of the Naltorian Dreamers batball team. Thom retired from heroics and became their coach, though he did come out of retirement during <a href=\"..\/..\/zero-hour\/39-40782\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour<\/a>. With his timeline collapsing, Star Boy joined his past teammates in helping to rescue <a href=\"..\/..\/cosmic-boy\/29-1264\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Boy<\/a> and ultimately sacrificed himself to reboot the universe.<\/p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247<\/h3><h4>Star Boy in the 21st century<\/h4><p>As a Legionnaire, Star Boy was inducted with the draft dodging <a href=\"..\/..\/gates\/29-9969\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gates<\/a> and was often scrutinized by <a href=\"..\/..\/colossal-boy\/29-1271\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviathan<\/a>, who felt responsible for the death of Thom's predecessor and refused to let Thom end up like Kid Quantum. Star Boy helped assemble the Fatal Five and was one of many Legionnaires spared being trapped in the 20th century. When the Legion held open auditions for the first time, Star Boy was on the judging panel and it was there he met his future girlfriend, Dreamer. Thom was smitten with her and they began to date shortly thereafter. He returned to Xanthu several times to both cement his position in the Legion and to help ward off an invasion. He was distraught when Xanthu ceded from the <a href=\"..\/..\/united-planets\/65-56731\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Planets<\/a> to the Allied Planets and refused a call to return home with the other Xanthian Legionnaires. One visit to Xanthu also led him to team up with <a href=\"..\/..\/jack-knight\/29-23783\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Knight<\/a>, a time-lost hero named Starman.

Due to his liability in the field, Star Boy was sidelined. These powers ultimately faded and Thom returned to active duty in time to be captured during the Blight Invasion. He was later freed but elected to leave the Legion when Dreamer began having nightmares. They traveled to Xanthu and worked with the <a href=\"..\/..\/khunds\/65-18273\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khunds<\/a> to fine-tune both Dreamer and Thom's powers. Instead of just inducing mass, Star Boy learned how to decrease it as well.

They were saved from their exile weeks later by a reformed Legion, which Thom rejoined and later Dreamer joined as well.

He rejoined with the other Legionnaires and they successfully used lightning rods to gather the essence of the deceased <a href=\"..\/..\/bart-allen\/29-1680\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bart Allen<\/a>. When the other Legionnaires returned home, Thom remained in the past with the Justice Society to aid Brainiac 5 in one other contingency.

With his last mission in the past finally complete, Starman was presumed to return to the future.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><h3>Gravity Control<\/h3><p>Star Boy possesses the ability to control the gravitational force of an object. He does so by borrowing the gravity from stars and redirecting this force onto a designated area. He can sink cities and pinpoint it to objects smaller than pebbles. He is capable of drawing enough mass to create a black hole by recreating the weight of a collapsing star. Thom wears a suit crafted together by three different Brainiac 5's that is a map of the multiverse. It is fine tuned so that Thom's mass induction ability when properly applied can create small wormholes into these realities or transport himself. It is a skill he has yet to refine.<\/p><h3>Kryptonian<\/h3><p>Previously, after crashing through a comet tail, he gained the powers of a Kryptonian as well as the ability to breathe fire.

Afterward Tasmia was offered full membership into the Legion and she accepted, taking the code name of Shadow Lass.

At birth she was taken from her mother, the then-current Champion, in a bid to ensure that no single accident or attack could ever claim both of them, and saw her only seven times during her lifetime, all at solemn ceremonies in which they were forbidden to speak. As she grew up, she was raised by priests and was trained in combat and drilled in the order of her bloodline. She loved it. Finally, one day, her mother was killed in battle and she was brought before the leaders of Talok VIII's twelve tribes - the only time they would ever congregate peacefully - before entering the Shadow Cave, where she met the spirits of her mother and the other prior Champions. After they chastised her for never wondering how her mother died, she took to heart their counsel to protect Talok VIII (but not their warning against egocentrism) and they told her to Go In Power. On leaving the cave, she found the inhabitants of Talok VIII on their knees, waiting for a sign - which she provided when she let the Shadows loose. After that, she became the Champion, using her position to give orders to leaders and priests, all in maintenance of the Old Ways. This lasted until the ship came. The United Planets ship came in peace, proselytizing the benefits of U.P. membership. Sent to greet the \"invaders,\" she understood none of it , and she set about dismantling the \"hideous\" ship and crew. Despite their best efforts, she caused an explosion that caused the ship's landing gear to collapse. After that, the priests (who had already been harboring doubts about the \"zealot\") kept her drugged until UP entry negotiations were complete. Profoundly disturbed by the cultural influx and Talok's \"captitulance,\"she was eventually \"dismissed\" and told to study the galaxy to \"open her mind.\"<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Umbra's costume drew on the character's earlier and sexier 1970's look, consisting of a skimpy black bikini with a revealing open 'slash' pattern, long black boots and gloves, and a cape.

A cataclysmic battle then erased the Trapper from existence and completely rewrote reality, causing Shadow Lass to lose her husband yet again.<\/p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247<\/h3><h4>Legion Lost<\/h4><figure style=\"width: 480px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/26503\/759146-shadowlass.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-759146\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5491679273828\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/26503\/759146-shadowlass.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-759146\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"A colder Umbra\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/26503\/759146-shadowlass.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/26503\/759146-shadowlass.jpg\" alt=\"A colder Umbra\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A colder Umbra<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Tasmia eventually made her way to Earth, and entered the Legion tryouts and was accepted as Umbra, although her curt attitude irritated <a href=\"..\/..\/sensor\/29-9972\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sensor<\/a>. As part of the Legion, she fought Mordru, and later played a key part in saving <a href=\"..\/..\/wildfire\/29-3621\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wildfire<\/a> - despite, after her initial fierce compassion, being disgusted at the thought of the forcible integration of his two original souls. Far later, the Blight enslaved most of Earth, including all but a few of the Legionnaires. Umbra was not among these escapees. When she was freed, she began to have a mental breakdown, prompted not only by the fact of her enslavement and what she'd been forced to do, but by the fact that the Blight's touching of her mind had meant that she'd <i>enjoyed<\/i> it. Shortly thereafter, she became one of the Legionnaires lost through a space rift and catapulted into another galaxy. There, she became harder and colder than ever in lieu of breaking down completely and showing the fear that now guided her, while the voices of her ancestors from the shadow became faint and hard to understand. Then <a href=\"..\/..\/saturn-girl\/29-1273\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl<\/a> tried to telepathically calm her, and it all went wrong - a telepathic matrix over a whole planet interfered with her powers, and the result left Saturn Girl in a coma, a shadow-creature fueled by Umbra and Saturn Girl's combined pain and fear loose on the ship - and an Umbra completely without pain or anxiety, leaving only anger and arrogant self-confidence. She went down to the planet, where she began to fight <a href=\"\/singularity\/4005-12824\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12824\">Singularity<\/a> (a <a href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman<\/a>-like being), for whom the telepathic illusion which had caused the trouble was being maintained (to keep him from causing trouble on his race's real planet).

Finally, she was knocked out by Singularity while the Legion, having captured the shadow-creature and realized what it was, knocked out the illusion causing Singularity to go looking for his original planet. Then <a href=\"..\/..\/brainiac-5\/29-1255\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5<\/a> managed to restore Umbra and Saturn Girl's minds, and Umbra finally broke down in a crying heap.<\/p><h4>Return Home<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After this she finally began to heal from everything that had happened to her - until, after they managed to return to UP space, her power mysteriously cut out. To find out what had happened, she finally returned to Talok VIII for the first time since her dismissal. There she found a planet completely cloaked in shadow, and a shadow which knocked her out. Shadow Maven, one of the priests who had trained her, found her and told her that after her loss in the rift, they had believed her dead and managed to empower her \"distant cousin Grev\" with the shadows through the use of technology, and had him cloak the planet completely, withdrawing from the United Planets. Angry at the thought that just as she had accepted the galaxy Talok had turned away from it, she went to confront Grev. The shadow gradually leeched back to her, until she split open the suit Grev used to control the shadow - and found a withered corpse inside, as he had been unable to withstand being a conduit for the Shadow, while the suit ran on its last programmed directives. She cast the shadow-cloak from the planet, and spent some time there before returning to the Legion.<\/p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth<\/h3><h4>Affair with Earth-Man<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the start of current continuity Shadow Lass appeared to have broken up with Mon-El, with no reason truly given.

When Tasmia found out that Mon-El was chosen to be a <a href=\"\/green-lantern\/4015-41148\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\">Green Lantern<\/a>, she felt a bit uneasy about it. However Mon-El told her that even though his part of the Corp, the Legion and Earth will always be his family.

The intense darkness that she creates can engulf large areas of space almost instantly, causing an absolute absence of light which very few (like <a href=\"..\/..\/projectra\/29-6797\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sensor Girl<\/a>) can penetrate with their vision. Shadow Lass is able to control the shape of her darkness, from a large amorphous cloud to a tight beam of concentrated shadows.

Unfortunately Luornu suffered an unhappy home life; at a young age she was abandoned by her father and her mother became an alcoholic. Luornu was then raised by her grandmother who encouraged the differences between the Luornu's separated bodies. But after her grandmother passed away, Luornu fell into the custody of a Carggite government that frowned upon non-synchronized behavior. Lu was placed in a special institution, almost like an insane asylum, to 'deprogram' the individuality out of Lu's selves. Feeling tortured, she managed to escape and came across the third richest sentient in the world, R.J. Brande. Brande took pity on Luornu and took her in.

Luornu reached the limit of clones she could make and populated Cargg, sometimes combining together to amass the knowledge of every clone and spread it evenly.<\/p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth<\/h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3347\/1820672-duplicate_damsel_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1820672\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6973415132924\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:169.7%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3347\/1820672-duplicate_damsel_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1820672\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Duplicate Girl\/Damsel (New Earth)\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3347\/1820672-duplicate_damsel_5.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3347\/1820672-duplicate_damsel_5.jpg\" alt=\"Duplicate Girl\/Damsel (New Earth)\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Duplicate Girl\/Damsel (New Earth)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The \"Retroboot\" returned the Legion to a close approximation of the original team prior to the Five Year Gap. Luornu was once again Duo Damsel and wore her classic DD costume. During the <a href=\"\/the-lightning-saga\/4045-56223\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56223\">Lightning Saga<\/a>, one of Duo Damsel's two bodies traveled to the 21st century to join <a href=\"..\/..\/karate-kid\/29-1269\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid<\/a> on an assignment. Because her other body was still in the 31st century she couldn't duplicate, so while on the mission she called herself \"Una.\" Tragically, both Una and Karate Kid were killed in action in the 21st century. But when Una died, Luornu's single remaining body in the 31st century somehow received a major power upgrade, gaining the ability to split into any number of bodies. Luornu changed her name to Duplicate Damsel and later to Duplicate Girl. She and her husband <a href=\"..\/..\/bouncing-boy\/29-21506\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bouncing Boy<\/a> joined the battle against <a href=\"..\/..\/superboy-prime\/29-40756\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime<\/a> the <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-of-super-villains\/65-47190\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Super-Villains<\/a>, she had just returned from their third honeymoon at the back beaches of Ventura.

While on the planet, Luornu's separated body somehow became corrupted and evil, and she began calling herself \"Lelith.\" In a demonstration of her ruthlessness, Lelith ordered Nam'Lor to kill Bouncing Boy (who harbored a crush on Luornu but was not yet her boyfriend). Nam'Lor refused to do so and finally determined that his own 'Hyber-Aura' (which was the source of his powers) had adversely affected Luornu's mind and caused her to become evil, so he abandoned her. The effect of his hyber-aura wore off and Lelith became Luornu again. But when she left Ikros and merged back into one body, Luornu found that Lelith's mind was still present and sealed off from her own mind, and she had to fight to expel the evil from her second body. This incident marked the first time that one of Luornu's separated bodies developed an adverse personality.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> <\/p><h4>Marriage to Bouncing Boy<\/h4><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/1372646-duodamsel_wedding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1372646\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2429577464789\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29837\/1372646-duodamsel_wedding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1372646\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Luornu's wedding\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/1372646-duodamsel_wedding.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/29837\/1372646-duodamsel_wedding.jpg\" alt=\"Luornu's wedding\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Luornu's wedding<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Bouncing Boy lost his powers (temporarily as it turned out), he decided to propose marriage to Luornu, they became the Legion's first married couple.

After the ceremony, both Chuck and Lu resigned from active duty and became Legion reservists (due to Legion bylaws, married Legionnaires could not serve full-time). But after Chuck's powers returned, he and Luornu often returned to duty to help the Legion on missions. Luornu also joined the Legion Espionage Squad, a special branch of the Legion that handled covert missions. She also decided to become teacher along with her husband and ran the <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-academy\/65-47210\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Academy<\/a>, a school designed to train prospective Legion members.

Luornu's actions that day inspired the three founding Legionnaires (Saturn Girl, Live Wire, and Cosmic Boy) to invite her to be their first recruit.

When she assimilated back together, she gained the knowledge that each body had experienced while separated. Though her three bodies were shown to bicker on occasion, they were generally portrayed as being completely harmonious with each other.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Duo Damsel<\/b> (Original Continuity): After one of her bodies was murdered by Computo, Luornu could only split into two identical bodies. To reflect this loss, she changed her name to Duo Damsel and her costume's orange\/purple color scheme became split down the middle. Her ability to survive and fully operate despite the loss of her third body was considered unique among her race and she retained full membership in the Legion.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Una<\/b> (Original Continuity): Near the end of original Legion continuity, Luornu's second body was destroyed in a battle with one the Legion's greatest enemies, the Time Trapper. Though once again she defied the odds and survived the loss of yet another body, with only one body remaining she was essentially powerless. She changed her code name to Una and resigned from active duty.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Triad<\/b> (Earth-247): Unlike other incarnations, the reboot (Earth-247) Triad's bodies manifested three separate and distinct personalities who shared a mental and physical link, which was considered highly unusual among Carggites. One personality was her \"normal\" self, the second was aggressive and extroverted, and the third was shy and introverted. Because of her separate personalities she preferred to remain in triplicated form. At one point each body also manifested very different physical characteristics to reflect their different personalities (though they still had the same facial features): The aggressive one became unusually tall and strong, the shy one became much smaller and faster, and the \"normal\" personality remained the same size.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Triplicate Girl<\/b> (Earth-Prime): The \"threeboot\" Luornu was different from other incarnations, in that while on her home planet of Cargg she could apparently create an unlimited number of duplicates. However, she could not duplicate once off the planet. Eventually three of her bodies decided to combine into one body and leave the planet, since in this manner she could still split into three separate bodies while away from Cargg. The result was that this Luornu essentially had the same powers as the Triplicate Girl of original continuity, despite a notably different origin. However, the vast number of Luornu duplicates still remaining on Cargg rejected assimilation with the Triplicate Girl Luornus when they tried to return home, leaving Triplicate Girl on her own and completely isolated from her native Carggite bodies.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Duplicate Girl\/Damsel<\/b> (Retroboot): Luornu finally received a major power upgrade in current Legion continuity. She now has the power to split herself into an apparently endless number of identical bodies no matter where she is. It is not yet known if there is any upper limit to her duplication ability. To reflect her newfound power she changed her code name to Duplicate Damsel and then to Duplicate Girl, though she has gone back to wearing a variation of her classic 1970's Duo Damsel costume.<\/p><h3>Unarmed Combat<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In all of her forms, Luornu has mastered a specialized Carggite form of martial arts called Trijitsu, which was developed by her people to take full advantage of three forms fighting simultaneously.

Anything we ever shared physically ... it was in spite of the ProFem, not because of it ... !\"<\/em> Whether Jan is gay or bisexual in the New 52 reality is yet to be revealed.<\/p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247<\/h3><h4>Jan Transmuted Himself<\/h4><p>Element Lad continued to explore the limits of his abilities, even successfully transmuting <i>himself<\/i>. He discovered this somewhat by accident with the sorcerer Mordru turned him to crystal. Though his awareness was expanded, he found it more difficult to change other objects unless he first changed himself to a similar substance. The transformation made Jan's mind somewhat unstable for a while.<\/p><h4>Legion Lost<\/h4><p>Following the Blight's attack on Earth, Element Lad was one of ten Legionnaires who disappeared into a rift in space. The rift transported them into a void. He was the first to awake and transformed himself into Tromium crystal in order to survive. He gathered up the Legionnaires and sheathed them in Tromium as well, which had the effect of time-stasis.<\/p><h4>Enter Progenitor<\/h4><p>Recording his thoughts in memory crystals, he calculated a way to move the Outpost back to ordinary space. He was successful, but the Legion re-entered space in another galaxy, far from home. Jan himself entered the same galaxy, but billions of years in its past, while the universe was in its infancy. The Tromium made him immortal, and he drifted for billions of years, completely alone, watching stars and planets come into being. When planets began to bear life, he used his powers to accelerate their evolution. His tinkering gave rise to many races, including the Progeny and the Kwai. He eventually became known as the Progenitor and created for himself a home world called the Rosette. By this point, there was very little of the boy who was Jan Arrah. The Progenitor acted like a god, ordering the Progeny to \"delete\" any life forms which he considered \"variants.\" Eventually his timeline caught up to that of his fellow Legionnaires. They had been fighting the Progeny and finally met the aliens' master. Jan barely remembered them.<\/p><h4>The Death of Progenitor<\/h4><p>When he learned that they intended to return to their home galaxy, the Progenitor hatched a plan to follow them. He intended to remake that galaxy, too. He told the Legionnaires that he also intended to destroy all life in this Second Galaxy before he left. Of course, his former teammates could not allow either of these things. When they opposed the Progenitor, he killed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12837\" href=\"\/monstress\/4005-12837\/\">Monstress<\/a>. To defeat him, the Legion managed to release the Omniphagos, a being that the Progenitor intended to use to erase all life. It took all the Progenitor's powers to subdue the creature. Meantime, the Legionnaires made it through a space warp home. They lost another one of their number, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1253\" href=\"\/lightning-lad\/4005-1253\/\">Live Wire<\/a>, who sacrificed himself to overload the Omniphagos with electricity.<\/p><h4>Live Wire is Element Lad<\/h4><p>Back home, Element Lad was memorialized on Trom with the memory crystals that remained from the Second Galaxy. In time, something miraculous happened\u2014Live Wire emerged from the crystals, his mind imprinted on the former crystalline body of Element Lad! With the help of the Brainiac 5 of Earth-0, Live Wire eventually recovered enough to change his own form back to normal.<\/p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime<\/h3><h4>The Death of Element Lad<\/h4><p>Like every active Legionnaire of his world and Earth-247, Element Lad was transported to the 31st century New Earth, to help the present Legion combat <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\" href=\"\/superman-prime\/4005-40756\/\">Superboy-Prime<\/a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47190\" href=\"\/legion-of-super-villains\/4060-47190\/\">Legion of Super-Villains<\/a>. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1259\" href=\"\/sun-boy\/4005-1259\/\">Sun Boy<\/a> was murdered by Superboy-Prime on New Earth, Element Lad decided to put his qualms about violence aside to avenge his friend. He managed, notably enough, to create Kryptonite that Superboy-Prime showed to be vulnerable against (he had earlier been immune to the radioactive substance, due to Kryptonians only being affected by Kryptonite from their respective universes). In his rampage, Prime responded by launching one of the Kryptonite rocks through Element Lad's torso, killing him. A while after Prime was defeated, Brainiac 5 of New Earth explained that the reason Prime was vulnerable to Jan's Kryptonite, was that Element Lad and his Legion were from the reality of Earth-Prime themselves.<\/p><p>During the events of Legion of Three Worlds, the Element Lad native to the New Earth universe (supposedly the same as the original, pre-Crisis version of him) had been reported as missing. The Legion had not heard from him since the start of <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55650\" href=\"\/superman-and-the-legion-of-superheroes\/4045-55650\/\">Earth-Man's xenophobic campaign<\/a>.<\/p><h4>Black Lantern Element Lad<\/h4><p>Element Lad was one of many people who Superboy-Prime had killed, he travel from the future to Earth-Prime to kill Prime.<\/p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<\/h2><h3>Transmute<\/h3><p>Element Lad have the ability to transmute substances on the atomic level.

The Element Lad of Earth-Prime's transformations only lasted 60 seconds, and he had to be in contact with the material.<\/p><h3>Divine Powers<\/h3><p>The Element Lad of Earth-247 he had also learned how to change his own chemical make-up. As the Progenitor, he lived over billions of years, in the Second Galaxy. In this time, he learned to use his abilities to actually create (or destroy) life, making him near-omnipotent.<\/p><h3>Equipment<\/h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Element Lad possesses a <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-flight-ring\/18-47353\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring<\/a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower.

At some point, Cos ended his relationship with Night Girl so that he could concentrate solely on the Legion and take care of the team so others, like the married Ranzzes, wouldn't have to worry. Cos, as leader, continued to deal with politics following Earth's bout of xenophobia and the Titanian refugees after Titan was destroyed. The pressure reminded Cos how much he disliked the politics of being Legion leader and he posted a call for a new leader election.<\/p><h3>Post-Flashpoint \/ Earth 0<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/99801\/2187669-ac_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2187669\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.55238095238095\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/99801\/2187669-ac_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2187669\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Cosmic Man (Earth 0)\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/9\/99801\/2187669-ac_18.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static8.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/9\/99801\/2187669-ac_18.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Man (Earth 0)\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Cosmic Man (Earth 0)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Following the conclusion of <a href=\"..\/..\/flashpoint\/39-56280\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flashpoint<\/a>, the various timelines were united and rebooted once again. The Legion's timeline changed slightly where they still reached out to a young Clark Kent long before he became Superman, but they Legion grew up along with Clark and have changed their names to reflect their age. Imra changed her name to Saturn Woman and her along with Lighting Lad (Now Lightning Man) and Saturn Girl (Now Saturn Woman) reunited with an adult Clark Kent in an effort to stop the <a href=\"..\/..\/anti-superman-army\/65-58873\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anti-Superman army<\/a> from destroying the original rocket that took Clark to Earth. They succeeded in saving the rocket and keeping he timeline intact.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Silver Age:<\/h3><h4><b>The Great Darkness Saga<\/b><\/h4><p>Cosmic Boy leads a squad of Legionnaires consisting of <a href=\"\/wildfire\/4005-3621\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3621\">Wildfire<\/a>, <a href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superboy<\/a>, <a href=\"\/phantom-girl\/4005-1257\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1257\">Phantom Girl<\/a> and the newest <a href=\"\/jacques-foccart\/4005-26646\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26646\">Invisible Kid<\/a>. Once they arrive their attacked by their shadowy foes who continues talking about the coming darkness while casually battling the assembled squad before retreating with the wand. Cosmic Boy then gathers his squad and races to London to prevent the ancient sword Excalibur from being stolen but Cosmic Boy alongside Phantom Girl and Superboy are sent flying as Invisible Kid and Wildfire fail to prevent the newest shadow minion's escape with the sword. The squad then scrambles to prevent the theft of an ancient orb, but they fail but manage to capture one of \"The Masters\" shadow servants. Following several missions by three teams of Legionnaires Cosmic Boy calls to the worried Saturn Girl, but is attacked mid-call causing Saturn Girl to rush to his aid to find the captured servant to be the attacker.After a short battle however the two are defeated and only saved by Lightning Lad's arrival knocking out the monster.<\/p><p>Cosmic Boy alongside Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad are the Legionnaires to discover the identities of three of the shadow servants being <a href=\"\/darkstar\/4005-47236\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47236\">Lydea Mallor<\/a>, Superman and a Guardian of the Universe. Learning this prompts Cosmic Boy to send out a general alert to all Legionnaires. Cosmic Boy then takes part in the battle against the <a href=\"\/daxamites\/4060-42480\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42480\">Daxamites<\/a> under the control of <a href=\"\/darkseid\/4005-2349\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid<\/a>, being part of the team to distract him as <a href=\"\/element-lad\/4005-1263\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1263\">Element Lad<\/a> added lead into the atmosphere to activate their vulnerability. He later joins his teammates in an effort to capture the weakened Darkseid, but they fail as he flees. However following Darkseid's defeat he suffers another loss as a terrorist detonates a bomb in the city doing much damage, including to Cosmic Boy's home forcing his entire family to be hospitalized and leading to the death of his mother.<\/p><h4>Legionnaires 3<\/h4><p>Cosmic Boy was visiting the now newly retired Lightning Lad, Saturn Girl and his god son Graym. It just happened to be the weekend in which the Legion's greatest foe attacked kidnapping <a href=\"\/graym-ranzz\/4005-52820\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52820\">Graym<\/a> and delivering the challenge that only the three Legionnaires can battle him this time or he the child dies. Cosmic Boy then prepares to aid in the rescue of his godson visiting Metropolis University to request a leave of absence from coaching the Mangaball team. The three then head to Legion ally, <a href=\"\/rond-vidar\/4005-12860\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12860\">Rond Vidar<\/a> explaining the situation in confidence to gain a time machine but refuses prompting Saturn Girl to incapacitate him. Cosmic Boy then uses a distorter to assume the appearance of Rond leading them to a time cube as an officer attempts to stop them forcing Cosmic Boy to use his powers on him as he alongside his two friends activate the time cube.<\/p><p>The three then arrive at the the end of time, with the Time Trapper personally allowing a gap in the time barrier so the three can enter. The three then begin to battle the Trapper's minions in their efforts to kill the Legionnaires,but are captured by the surprise his minions are human bombs which releases nerve gas knocking them out and bringing them to his stronghold.Lightning Lad is then separated as Saturn Girl and Cosmic Boy escape battling Trapper's minions through out the citadel and gaining his aide Otok as a guide. He leads the two to Graym as they realize that he is well taken care of that Lightning Lad has been the true target. However the hour glass runs out before the Time Trapper can break Lightning Lad's sanity, as a result he sends all of them home to a point just shortly after they left.<\/p><h3>Five Years Later:<\/h3><h4>The New Time Trapper<\/h4><p>Cosmic Boy was the easy choice when the team reformed to lead again. Even though he was powerless, the other Legionnaires looked to him. Cosmic Boy and the Legion helped free Earth from the Dominators and saved Earth's populace when the planet exploded. A younger counterpart of Cosmic Boy, as well as the Legion from their early years, were discovered and went on to become the <a href=\"..\/..\/legionnaires\/65-56923\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires<\/a> of <a href=\"..\/..\/new-earth\/34-57126\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Earth<\/a>. <a href=\"..\/..\/brainiac-5\/29-1255\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5<\/a> eventually created gauntlets for Cosmic Boy that would replicate his powers; however they slowly modified his personality and drove him mad. Shrinking Violet stepped in as leader. Going by Polestar now, he left the team to single-handedly rebuild Earth. He was subdued, but then captured by <a href=\"..\/..\/glorith\/29-26385\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/mordru\/29-4904\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordru<\/a> during the Legion's last hours before <a href=\"..\/..\/zero-hour\/39-40782\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour<\/a>. The whole Legion, past and present, rallied to save Rokk. and he managed to escape, but was lost in a library where time past differently. For hundreds of years, he lived in this library and studied the art of time manipulation. He ended up becoming the Legion's oldest foe, the <a href=\"..\/..\/time-trapper\/29-25998\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper<\/a>. The Time Trapper freed his past self just as reality was coming to an end. Cosmic Boy merged with his SW6 counterpart, alongside the other Legion founders, as the last beings in the universe in order to reset time.<\/p><h3>Reboot \/ Earth-247:<\/h3><h4>Trapped In The 20th Century<\/h4><p>While Legionnaires like <a href=\"..\/..\/xs\/29-40802\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XS<\/a> harbored a crush on Cosmic Boy, his eyes were set on Saturn Girl despite her fondness for Live Wire. She was his heart's desire and after an explosion left he and Imra stranded in the 20th century, the two began a romance much to the ire of Garth's sister, <a href=\"..\/..\/lightning-lass\/29-30997\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spark<\/a>. he enjoyed spending time with the heroes of legend he had grown up with during the team's exile. Cosmic Boy was left mentally comatose after Imra's mind was attacked by Dr. Psycho while he was linked, though he was ultimately revived by Saturn Girl's heightened powers. Unfortunately, she had just been subconsciously manipulating his body. Once she realized this, he was revived properly and in shame Imra ended their relationship and admitted she still had feelings for Garth. He hid his hurt and resolved to reunite Garth and Imra, which he did when their team returned to the 30th century.<\/p><h4>The New Wanderers<\/h4><p>Following the <a href=\"..\/..\/blight\/29-51354\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blight<\/a> invasion of Earth and half the team being thought for dead, the Legion was disbanded. Cosmic Boy secretly served R.J. Brande as a mercenary Legionnaire while Brande prepared Legion World and the reformation of a new Legion. When the Legionnaires thought lost returned and the team reformed, Cos became defacto leader. He helped end <a href=\"..\/..\/ras-al-ghul\/29-40816\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ra's al Ghul<\/a>'s reign as secret president of the United Planets before calling for a new leader. Impressed by <a href=\"..\/..\/kid-quantum\/29-1520\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kid Quantum II<\/a> during the Ra's battle, he nominated her as his replacement and the Legion voted her in. After the incident, the two began a flirtation that became a romance. When <a href=\"..\/..\/superboy\/29-1686\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy<\/a> was a member of the team, Cos rode him hard because he felt Kon wasn't living up to the legacy of Superman. Eventually, Earth-247 was destroyed and Cos and his Legionnaires were spared because they were lost in the timestream. After assisting two other Legions in defeating <a href=\"..\/..\/superboy-prime\/29-40756\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime<\/a>, he and Kid Quantum led their Legion into the <a href=\"..\/..\/dc-multiverse\/12-43603\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiverse<\/a> to become the new <a href=\"..\/..\/wanderers\/65-47418\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Threeboot \/ Earth-Prime:<\/h3><h4>Cosmic Boy Leaves The Team<\/h4><p>When <a href=\"..\/..\/supergirl\/29-2351\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl<\/a> joined the team, he was instrumental in helping her realize she wasn't dreaming and the two had a brief romance. Cosmic Boy was captured and tortured by <a href=\"..\/..\/dominators\/65-56539\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators<\/a>, but it was all part of a plan to trick them into going to a wrong location. Cosmic Boy's last and most controversial move as leader was ordering the dying Mon-El to take a bomb to the heart of the Dominator planet and destroy it. In actuality, the bomb was a phantom zone projector that locked the Dominators away from Earth. Cos kept this a secret from even his close friends to prevent anyone freeing them. Sending a noble hero to his \"death\" as well as exterminating an entire race was poorly received by the Legionnaires and the public alike. A public leader election for the Legion was called and Supergirl replaced him. A trio of heroes from the Knights Tempus of the 41st century then appeared to Cosmic Boy. They told him that he was regarded in history as one of the greatest heroes ever and they invited him to join their team. Cos accepted and left the Legion. He never returned, though his war crimes were eventually pinned on <a href=\"..\/..\/lightning-lord\/29-3592\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lord<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><h3>Magnetism<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83063\/2005970-cos15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005970\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 472px\" data-ratio=\"0.98093220338983\" data-width=\"472\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.1%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83063\/2005970-cos15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005970\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Magnetic Powers\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/83063\/2005970-cos15.jpg\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static9.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/83063\/2005970-cos15.jpg\" alt=\"Magnetic Powers\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Magnetic Powers<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Cosmic Boy's superpower is super-magnetism.

After merging with Phase, Apparition was restored to physicality and the Ultra lovebirds returned to the 30th century. They were separated twice thereafter, once when Apparition was off-world and Ultra Boy was possessed during the Blight Invasion and again when Ultra Boy is lost in another galaxy with a team of Legionnaires. Ultra Boy initially believed Apparition was lost with him, but he and the Legion soon learned that Tinya was merely a telepathic illusion made by <a href=\"..\/..\/saturn-girl\/29-1273\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl<\/a> to keep the powerful Ultra Boy in-line.

There is a thank you to DC Comics for allowing the use of the name at the end of the credits.<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><h3>Silver Age<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-478462\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25838\/478462-karatekidlightle.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5185185185185\" data-width=\"351\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 351px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25838\/478462-karatekidlightle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-478462\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/25838\/478462-karatekidlightle.jpg\" alt=\"Karate Kid (Silver Age)\"><\/a><figcaption>Karate Kid (Silver Age)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Val fell in with his fellow Legion recruit <a href=\"\/sensor-girl\/4005-6797\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6797\">Princess Projectra<\/a>, he follow Projectra to her homeworld of Orando.

Becoming a full fledged officer of the Science Police on Mars, Gim was actually reluctant unlike his previous counterpart to get pulled from S.P. duty to become Mars' official draftee into the new Legion of Super-Heroes as Leviathan.

Gim took the codename Micro Lad due to his shrinking ability, though most Legionnaires called him Colossal Boy due to the fact it seemed to them that growing to his 'normal height' was actually the super power. Sometimes considered to be a little on the dim side, Colossal Boy was still a great friend and regarded highly by many Legionnaires.<\/p><p>He even allowed the Legion to stay at his giant-sized house for a time.

The precise limitations on this power have not been established, nor the exact extent to which his strength increases with size, an apparent side effect of the growth. When Gim loses consciousness, he is returned to his normal size. In the threeboot continuity, Gim was actually from a race of giants and his ability was that he could <i>shrink<\/i> to a 6' height rather than the other way around.

When Saturn Girl learned that a Legionnaire was fated to die on a mission, she used her mental powers to influence the team to elect her as team leader. In so doing, she had the authority to bench the rest of the team and sacrifice her own life to spare those of her teammates. But <a href=\"..\/..\/lightning-lad\/29-1253\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lad<\/a>, who had feelings for Saturn Girl, defied her orders and sacrificed his own life to save her. Grief-stricken by Lightning Lad's death, Saturn Girl then tried sacrifice her own life again in order to bring him back to life, but this time her telepathic friend <a href=\"..\/..\/proty\/29-12861\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Proty<\/a> took her place. Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad then declared their love for each other. Despite learning that Saturn Girl had rigged the election, her teammates continued to support her as leader of the Legion. She had a celebrated first year as Legion leader and even won a challenge the next year to legitimately earn a second term; a first in Legion history. Saturn Girl served stalwartly on the Legion, dedicating her life to the team even after her stint as leader ended. She and Lightning Lad dated for several years, even staging a fake marriage for a Legion mission before he proposed actual marriage.<\/p><p>Saturn Girl spent most of original continuity in her trademark 'red skirt' costume, featuring a white front with a yellow Saturn logo on her chest. Like many Legionnaires she underwent a sexy makeover during the 1970's, wearing a daring pink bikini-like outfit with long pink boots and gloves and the Saturn logo on her navel where the bikini top and bottom joined. In the 1980's she switched back to her more modest red skirt costume, which lasted until the end of original continuity.<\/p><p> <\/p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1494\/85206-164509-saturn-girl.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-85206\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1494\/85206-164509-saturn-girl.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-85206\"><img src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" alt=\"Saturn Girl (Earth-247)\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1494\/85206-164509-saturn-girl.png\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1494\/85206-164509-saturn-girl.png\" alt=\"Saturn Girl (Earth-247)\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Saturn Girl (Earth-247)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As a child, Imra Ardeen displayed top-level telepathic abilities and was taken from her family at the age of five to begin years of intense mental training with the best minds of Titan. Her younger sister, Jancel, would resent Imra for this and viewed it as special treatment despite the fact Imra initially hated it. Imra became very disciplined and excelled at all she did, earning the rank of a tenth level telepath and being so strong that her mentor, Aven, installed mental blocks to dampen Imra's power. She was fast-tracked to become a Science Police officer and was assigned to Earth despite the stigma against telepaths there. En route, she and two bystanders saved the life of R.J. Brande.

Blaze was defeated and Shazam contained the Seven within ridiculous containment shells.

data-ref-id=\"4000-136261\">Police Comics #8<\/a> which was written by <a href=\"\/tex-blaisdell\/4040-32674\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-32674\">Tex Blaisdell<\/a> and drawn by <a href=\"\/alex-kotzky\/4040-57162\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-57162\">Alex Kotzky<\/a>. Dan Richards had graduated at the bottom of his Police Academy class while his friend, Jim, had graduated with top honors. When Jim refused to kill for a corrupt politician, Jim was framed for murder. Richards became the <a href=\"\/manhunter\/4005-2529\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2529\">Manhunter<\/a> to prove Jim's innocence and capture the real killer. The Manhunter solved the case and captured the real murderer based on secret files he had gathered on known criminals. Richards continued being the Manhunter whenever the authorities were unable to solve mysteries or capture criminals.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Manhunter had a dog as a partner named Thor, the <a href=\"\/thunderdog\/4005-75164\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75164\">Thunderdog<\/a>, that was always nearby when Richards walked his patrol as a policeman. Thor would join the Manhunter when he blew a supersonic whistle that was inaudible to human ears. Thor was an excellent tracker and attack dog. The Manhunter worked briefly with the <a href=\"\/all-star-squadron\/4060-41753\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41753\">All-Star Squadron<\/a> then later joined the <a href=\"\/freedom-fighters\/4060-40383\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40383\">Freedom Fighters<\/a>. The Manhunter met another costumed hero of the same name, <a href=\"\/paul-kirk-ii\/4005-63251\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63251\">Paul Kirk<\/a>, when both were members of the All-Star Squadron. Both Manhunters later worked together with the <a href=\"\/young-all-stars\/4060-41754\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41754\">Young All-Stars<\/a>. The Manhunter continued his crime-fighting career at least into the 1950s. At some point, Richards retired from being the Manhunter.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Richards eventually learned about the ancient sect of <a href=\"\/the-manhunters\/4060-55857\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55857\">Manhunters<\/a> but not about their evil, murderous plans. Believing the Manhunters to be a force for good, Richards convinced his granddaughter, Marcie Cooper, to join them. During the <a href=\"\/millennium\/4045-40776\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40776\">Millennium<\/a> event, Richards learned of the evil nature of the Manhunters when Marcie appeared as the <a href=\"\/harlequin\/4005-24282\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24282\">Harlequin<\/a> and attacked him and <a href=\"\/molly-maynne-scott\/4005-9309\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9309\">Molly Mayne Scott<\/a>. Richards and Molly Scott escaped from the Harlequin but Molly was injured in the process. Richards took Molly to a hospital where she recovered from her injuries.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Later, the Harlequin was defeated by <a href=\"\/jade\/4005-3406\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3406\">Jade<\/a> and <a href=\"\/obsidian\/4005-9359\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9359\">Obsidian<\/a> assisted by Richards. The Harlequin was eventually killed in a confrontation between <a href=\"\/infinity-inc\/4060-40384\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40384\">Infinity, Inc<\/a> and <a href=\"\/injustice-unlimited\/4060-55733\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55733\">Injustice, Unlimited<\/a>. A few years later, Richards was murdered by Mark Shaw also known as the Manhunter and the <a href=\"\/privateer\/4005-47040\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47040\">Privateer<\/a>. Shaw was deranged, assumed the identity of a killer known as Dumas and was killing other Manhunters such as Richards.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><b>Powers\/Abilities:<\/b><\/p><p>Though he had no superpowers,Manhunter was trained well as a fighter and a gymnast.

She began her crime-fighting as the masked Blue Bulleteer using a pair of revolvers as her main weapon. In the 1960's she became the pupil of the wizard <a href=\"\/azagoth\/4005-31039\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31039\">Azagoth<\/a>. He took her to another dimension called <a href=\"\/limbo\/4020-42990\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\">Limbo<\/a> for her magic training. She later reappeared on earth as Nightveil, with her youth regained and ready to fight crime again.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>The story of Nightveil's creation is a complicated one. In the early 1970's, <a href=\"\/ac\/4010-335\/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-335\">AC<\/a> Comics began using the <a href=\"\/golden-age-of-comics\/4015-55820\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\">Golden Age<\/a> character of <a href=\"\/phantom-lady\/4005-32175\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32175\">Phantom Lady<\/a> (aka Sandra Knight) in their titles, believing that the character was now in the <a href=\"\/public-domain-characters\/4015-55750\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55750\">Public Domain<\/a>. They starting out by reprinting her Fox Feature era issues from the 1950's, and eventually began featuring Phantom Lady in their own original stories. However, <a href=\"\/dc-comics\/4010-10\/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC<\/a> Comics had claimed ownership of the Phantom Lady, stating they had purchased the copyrights of Golden Age <a href=\"\/quality-comics\/4010-15\/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-15\">Quality Comics<\/a> characters, including Phantom Lady, <a href=\"\/human-bomb\/4005-4926\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4926\">Human Bomb<\/a>, <a href=\"\/doll-man\/4005-23313\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23313\">Doll Man<\/a> and others.<\/p><p>Not wanting to engage in a lawsuit with the larger publisher, AC rewrote their version of the Phantom Lady, changing her name to the <b>Blue Bulleteer<\/b> and giving her pistols as weapons. They further decided to modernize her character by placing her in the extra-dimensional plane of Limbo with a magical mentor named Azagoth, while decades passed in our world. Laura emerged from Limbo in modern times with new powers and a new identity, calling herself Nightveil, and has since adapted to the current time period.<\/p><p>As it turns out, the copyright to <b>some<\/b> of Phantom Lady's earlier appearances are now in the Public Domain, while DC continues to maintain that the original Golden Age version published by Quality Comics is owned by their company (this version can be easily distinguished from the Public Domain version since she wears a yellow and green costume, rather than red and blue). <\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Powers and Paraphernalia<\/h2><p>Nightveil wields formidable magical powers including teleportation, levitation, and retrocognition, to name a few. Her powers are connected to her <a href=\"\/cloak-of-darkness\/4055-56510\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56510\">Cloak of Darkness<\/a>, an inherently evil magical artifact. While this makes her arguably among the most powerful beings on earth, Laura must constantly struggle to keep the evil influence of her Cloak in check. She is at times insecure in her own ability to do so and is disturbed by the possibility that the Cloak may already be corrupting her in some way. Because of this, she has developed a brooding personality and her <a href=\"\/femforce\/4060-27873\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-27873\">FemForce<\/a> teammates often have difficulty relating to her. She spends much of her time in solitude in her private sanctum, located somewhere in the <a href=\"\/everglades\/4020-56632\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56632\">Everglades<\/a>. She is responsible for bringing <a href=\"\/thunderfox\/4005-48281\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48281\">Thunderfox<\/a>, originally a fictional character, to life.<\/p><p>Laura seems to maintain the athleticism and agility from her earlier days as the Blue Bulleteer, but now tends to avoid hand-to-hand combat.

She is often really too strong for everyone in fact.\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Colt, the new leader of the team's, wants to recovers the real Joan. Despite her efforts, it did not work.

He appeared to be a normal human but was the result of genetic engineering, fusing together two fraternal twins while in the womb of their mother.

He learned to control it in adulthood and used both his male and female form as part of a series of disguises. He believed himself to be a superior being.

The art in the Fawcett run is superior art, especially in the early issues. The stories are excellent with much action and many thrills. While the Fawcett issues hail from the Golden Age of Comics and are prior to the Comics Code Authority censorship which began in the mid-1950's, there really are not that many bondage covers here. While there is a fair amount of bondage within the stories and Nyoka faces death door multiple times in many issues, this lovely girl is not the traditional Golden Age helpless female. Nyoka shows an unreal amount of resourcefulness and finds ways to get herself out of some of the worst jams one can imagine.<\/p><p>Apparently the Nyoka comicbook was popular, as Republic Pictures made two separate cliffhanger serials based upon the jungle heroine. The first one, Jungle Girl, was produced in 1941 and stars Frances Gifford as Nyoka. It is an excellent serial in it's own right, well above average by the way, but it cannot begin compare to the sequel. The 1942 Republic cliffhanger serial called The Perils of Nyoka is a masterpiece! This writer has over 100 cliffhanger serials in his personal collection and considers The Perils of Nyoka, aka Nyoka and the Tigermen, to be the best serial ever released! Lovely Kay Aldridge stars as Nyoka, with Lorna Gray taking the part of her rival and nemesis, Vultura. Clayton Moore of The Longer Ranger fame gets to act of Nyoka's main assistant and Charles Middleton from the Flash Gordon serials gets the part of Vultura's main ally. Not only are the actors and actresses cast perfectly here, but the chapter cliffhanger endings are quite frankly \"as good as it gets\". While many serials have a few cliffhanger endings that are exceptional, this 15-part serial is lucky enough to have every single cliffhanger as well above average and the vast majority of them are exceptional! Truth be told, there are so many first-rate cliffhanger endings in this serial, that it is almost an impossible task to choose which one is the best of all. As if anything else is needed to make this serial a classic, it is loaded with catfights! There are at least four separate fights between Nyoka and Vultura in this serial. One of the differences between the two Nyoka serials is that the 1941 version looks more like sub-Saharan Africa and the 1942 version reminds one more of North Africa locations. There also is a difference in the quality of the prints. While the 1941 serial is in relatively nice shape, the 1942 version looks even better.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The 1941 cliffhanger serial gave Nyoka the name of Nyoka Meredith.  However, the 1942 film changed her name to Nyoka Gordon. The Fawcett comic decided to go with the Gordon name, as it refers to her father as Dr. Gordon.<\/p><p>
