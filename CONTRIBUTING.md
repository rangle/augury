## I'm new. Anything I should know?

:wave: Hello and welcome. :wave: The answer to that question is yes, a lot. To help, here are few resources we thought you might find useful. Before you get started, it's worth looking over these
resources to make sure you're going the right thing. We'll update these from time to time so make sure you regularly skim this section, even if you've been contributing for a while.

### The manual

:book: [README](./README.md)

The first thing you should do is _read_ the [README](./README.md).
We've put a lot of love and care in writing it and it should provide
you with the context you need for contributing to this project. Really,
you should read it.

### The textbook

:mag: [Developer wiki](https://github.com/rangle/augury/wiki)

If you want to get technical, we've got you covered too. We have [a
README just for developers](https://github.com/rangle/augury/wiki). Jumping into a new codebase
can be daunting so we've tried, as best as we could, to give you an
overview into the design of Augury and our intentions. It's a
glimpse into our heads, if you will. We're not yet sure that's a good
thing but we can assure you it's a useful one.

### The chat room

:speech_balloon: [Slack](https://augury-slack.herokuapp.com/)

Okay, [manuals](./README.md) and [textbooks](https://github.com/rangle/augury/wiki) are great
and all but they make for poor conversation. Feel free to [join us on
Slack](https://augury-slack.herokuapp.com/)! Whether you're looking
for answers or just want to hang out and share funny pictures, there's a
channel for that. You can also ask us questions in private. We can't
wait to hear from you.

## Behaving yourself

:bangbang: [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

In the interest of making the Augury project a safe and friendly
place for people from diverse backgrounds, we'll be adhering to a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). As a contributor, you'll be expected to
uphold this code as well as report unacceptable behaviour to
[augury@rangle.io](mailto:augury@rangle.io).

## How do I actually contribute?

*Remember: No contribution is too small and no issue is too trivial. If you see a typo, we'd love to get a PR. We actually hate typos...they're the worst.*

### Bugs

:beetle: We are using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We will keep track on this and will to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing for a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

If you do find a new issue, the best way to get a bug fixed is to provide a test case with either one of the example apps bundled in the repo, or by making your own Angular 2.0 application illustrating the reduced use case. Don't forget to include the version of Angular 2.0 app you're using!

*At the moment, we offer limited backwards compatibility until Angular 2.0 stabilizes. Please check [README](./README.md#supported-version) for the version Augury currently supports.*


### Pull Requests

:shipit: The core team will be monitoring for pull requests.

*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, development workflow or aspects of the architecrure, update the corresponding documentation.
4. TypeScript linter is part of our build task, make sure your code lints before submitting your PRs.

### Coding Style

* Use semicolons;
* Commas last,
* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Prefer `'` over `"`
* 80 character line length
* ...

More information can be found in `tslint.json` file of this repository.
TypeScript linter is part of our build task and will run in either `npm run build` or `npm start`
