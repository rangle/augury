/// The intent of serialize() is to create a function that is itself able to

/// references and objects that are not normally serializable by something like
/// {@link JSON.stringify}. It returns a string containing the code for the
/// reconstructor function. That value can be passed to a Function constructor
/// which will parse it into a function that can then be invoked to recreate
/// the original object. In this way we are able to serialize an object for
/// transmission across thread boundaries even if it is very complex and
/// contains `unserializable' constructs (like circular references). This is
/// used in our message passing operations to reliably send complex objects.
